# HYPOTHESIS 3

**_We investigate the effects of various denoising methods on the final accuracy of brain tissue segmentation, and hypothesize that advanced denoising techniques improve segmentation performance more than standard denoising methods._**

_Pre-processing Category: Noise Reduction_

## Aim:
- To compare the effectiveness of advanced denoising methods (e.g., non-local means filtering) against standard techniques (e.g., Gaussian blurring) in enhancing segmentation performance.

## Things we could Explore:
1. **Denoising Methods Comparison:** Implement various denoising algorithms, ranging from simple filters to advanced techniques that preserve edges and fine details.
2. **Impact on Image Quality:** Analyze how each denoising method affects the image quality and the preservation of critical anatomical structures.
3. **Effect on Different Brain Regions:** Examine whether advanced denoising methods improve segmentation uniformly across all brain tissues or are more beneficial for certain structures.

## Experimental Design:
1. **Denoising Implementation:** Apply different denoising techniques to the same set of MR images to create multiple datasets.
2. **Consistency in Processing:** Ensure that other pre-processing steps remain constant across all datasets to isolate the effect of denoising methods.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train the segmentation model on each denoised dataset and evaluate performance using standard metrics.
4. **Qualitative Assessment:** Visually inspect segmentation outputs to understand the practical differences between denoising methods.
